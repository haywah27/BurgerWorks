## Description
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display said burger on the left side of the page -- "waiting to be devoured". Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks a devour button, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
